The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients.

                                                OBJECTIVES
This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.I am also going to try building a neural network for this particular project.
